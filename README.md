# PPRotator

Privateer Press has a gallery for their Warmachine and Hordes miniatures, where you could see most of their models in a 3D Rotator view. This view was based on Flash, so when Flash was deprecated, we all lost access to the 3D rotater view.

This browser addon/extension inserts javascript into the gallery pages to remedy the situation.

## Install

The addonn can be installed in Firefox from their Add-ons page: [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pprotator/]

It is still being reviewed at Microsoft and Google for Edge and Chrome. If you can't wait for this (can take a long time), you can download the code directy from here and install it manually.

### Chrome

1. Open the extensions overview using chrome://extensions (or click the three dots at the top of your browser, and then selecting Extensions)
2. Enable developer mode
3. Click on "Load Unpacked" and select the folder with the downloaded files.
4. The extension should now be installed. Enjoy :)

### Edge

1. Open the edge://extensions page (or click the three dots at the top of your browser, and then selecting Extensions)
2. Turn on Developer mode
3. Click on "Load Unpacked" and select the folder with the downloaded files.
4. The extension should now be installed. Enjoy :)
