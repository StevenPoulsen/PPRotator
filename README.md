# PPRotator

Privateer Press has a gallery for their Warmachine and Hordes miniatures, where you could see most of their models in a 3D Rotator view. This view was based on Flash, so when Flash was deprecated, we all lost access to the 3D rotater view.

This browser addon/extension inserts javascript into the gallery pages to remedy the situation.

## Install
You can either download the code from here and install it manually in almost any modern browser (via Developer mode), or you can install it from one of the official places (which is recommended in case of new versions)
